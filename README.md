So this will be updated eventually.

## Personal React Project
The idea of this project was to see if I can understand the fundamental things I've learned from studying React.  Specifically in this project I practiced my understanding of State, Passing State, Components, and Routing in React.

The App is fairly simple.  Each button leads a user to a page with that button explained.  There is a plus button on every page that allows a user to add a new entry into the list.  The new entry is added into the state with a picture and content.  

My plan is to push this into redux territory in a subsequent project which will let me make this a more MERN stack project over a simple Front End exercise.
